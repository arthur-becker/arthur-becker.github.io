The idea of SuSi came up in high school when I noticed that there was no digital organizer for school covering my needs for a tool that enables very quick organisation. Shortly after the idea came up, the COVID-19 pandemic began and showed the need not only individual, but collaborative organisers and platforms for schools. I found that these problems were worth solving, and decided to start this project during my last year in high school.
